  ```go
  {{< image src="/img/hello.png" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}
  ```
- **`figure`** (same as `image`, plus few optional props: **`caption`**, **`captionPosition`** (left | **center** is default | right), **`captionStyle`**)

    background: #1a1a1d;
    padding: 20px;
    border-radius: 8px;

    overflow: auto;

    @media (--phone) {
      white-space: pre-wrap;
      word-wrap: break-word;
    }

    code {
      background: none !important;
      color: #ccc;
      padding: 0;
      font-size: inherit;
    }
  }
  {{< /code >}}
  ```

  // your code here
```
````

## How to start

You can download the theme manually by going to [https://github.com/theskumar/hugo-theme-terminal.git](https://github.com/theskumar/hugo-theme-terminal.git) and pasting it to `themes/terminal` in your root directory.

You can also clone it directly to your Hugo folder:

```
git clone https://github.com/theskumar/hugo-theme-terminal.git themes/terminal
```

If you don't want to make any radical changes, it's the best option, because you can get new updates when they are available. You can also include it as a git submodule:

```
git submodule add -f https://github.com/theskumar/hugo-theme-terminal.git themes/terminal
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **The theme needs at least Hugo version 0.74.x**.

## How to run your site

If you installed all needed `npm` dependencies, then you can run:

```
hugo server -t terminal
```

and go to `localhost:1313` in your browser. From now on all the changes you make will go live, so you don't need to refresh your browser every single time.

## How to configure

The theme doesn't require any advanced configuration. Just copy:

```toml
baseurl = "/"
languageCode = "en-us"
theme = "terminal"
paginate = 5

[params]
  # dir name of your main content (default is `content/posts`).
  # the list of set content will show up on your index page (baseurl).
  contentTypeName = "posts"

  # ["orange", "blue", "red", "green", "pink"]
  themeColor = "orange"

  # if you set this to 0, only submenu trigger will be visible
  showMenuItems = 2

  # show selector to switch language
  showLanguageSelector = false

  # set theme to full screen width
  fullWidthTheme = false

  # center theme with default width
  centerTheme = false

  # if your resource directory contains an image called `cover.(jpg|png|webp)`,
  # then the file will be used as a cover automatically.
  # With this option you don't have to put the `cover` param in a front-matter.
  autoCover = true

  # set post to show the last updated
  # If you use git, you can set `enableGitInfo` to `true` and then post will automatically get the last updated
  showLastUpdated = false

  # set a custom favicon (default is a `themeColor` square)
  # favicon = "favicon.ico"

  # Provide a string as a prefix for the last update date. By default, it looks like this: 2020-xx-xx [Updated: 2020-xx-xx] :: Author
  # updatedDatePrefix = "Updated"

  # set all headings to their default size (depending on browser settings)
  # oneHeadingSize = true # default

  # whether to show a page's estimated reading time
  # readingTime = false # default

  # whether to show a table of contents
  # can be overridden in a page's front-matter
  # Toc = false # default

  # set title for the table of contents
  # can be overridden in a page's front-matter
  # TocTitle = "Table of Contents" # default


[params.twitter]
  # set Twitter handles for Twitter cards
  # see https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/guides/getting-started#card-and-content-attribution
  # do not include @
  creator = ""
  site = ""

[languages]
  [languages.en]
    languageName = "English"
    title = "Terminal"
    subtitle = "A simple, retro theme for Hugo"
    owner = ""
    keywords = ""
    copyright = ""
    menuMore = "Show more"
    readMore = "Read more"
    readOtherPosts = "Read other posts"
    newerPosts = "Newer posts"
    olderPosts = "Older posts"
    missingContentMessage = "Page not found..."
    missingBackButtonLabel = "Back to home page"

    [languages.en.params.logo]
      logoText = "Terminal"
      logoHomeLink = "/"

    [languages.en.menu]
      [[languages.en.menu.main]]
        identifier = "about"
        name = "About"
        url = "/about"
      [[languages.en.menu.main]]
        identifier = "showcase"
        name = "Showcase"
        url = "/showcase"
```

to `config.toml` file in your Hugo root directory and change params fields. In case you need, here's [a YAML version](https://gist.github.com/panr/9eeea6f595c257febdadc11763e3a6d1).

**NOTE:** Please keep in mind that currently `main menu` doesn't support nesting.

## How to (safely) edit the theme <a id="how-to-edit" />

If you have to override only some of the styles, you can do this easily by adding `static/style.css` in your root directory and point things you want to change.

To change something directly in the theme, you have to go to `themes/terminal` and modify the files.

First, you need to install Node dependencies. To do so, go to the theme directory (from your Hugo root directory):

```bash
 cd themes/terminal
```

 then run:

 ```bash
 npm install
 npm i yarn
 yarn
 ```

After you modified the files you can run webpack in watch mode:

```bash
yarn dev
```

or rebuild theme

```bash
yarn build
```

To see the changes (remember to restart `hugo server`).

## Found a bug? <a id="bug" />

If you spot any bugs, please use [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/theskumar/hugo-theme-terminal/issues) or create a new [Pull Request](https://github.com/theskumar/hugo-theme-terminal/pulls) to fix the issue.

## New cool idea or feature? <a id="feature" />

The theme is in constant development since 2019 and has got many cool features that helped many of you and made the theme better. But there were also many features that I wasn't sure about because I want to keep the theme as simple as possible.

So, let's say you have an idea of how to extend the theme. That's cool and you're welcome to do that, just follow these steps:

- fork the theme
- implement the feature
- write an instruction how to use the feature
- give a working example of the implementation for other users
- add info about your work to `COMMUNITY-FEATURES.md`
- make a PR with edited `COMMUNITY-FEATURES.md`

This will help keeping the theme close to its roots, and also allow anyone who wishes to improve it and match their needs, to do whatever they want.

Sounds OK? Cool, let's rock! ü§ò
